### Hi I'm Sean,
Also known as "The Big Panda"

I am currently a Software Engineer where I work on building applications in a microservice architecture using primarily .NET. I've built applications ranging from Console applications to cloud-based solutions in Node.js, Python, Java, and C++ but I've fallen in love with the .NET family over the course of this year. I enjoy working as a Full-Stack Engineer, whether it's working on building a React/Angular/Vue web application, designing backend services, or modeling data for a database system.

### What I'm Currently Working On
I haven't pushed much of my code to GitHub for the past year. I've mainly kept my side projects offline but I want to start jumping into the open-source scene. So I created a few projects that I wouldn't mind working with other developers on.
- [ ] [Job Hunt Service](https://github.com/sero-dev/JobHunt) - A .NET microservice for querying and saving the user's job applications in AWS DynamoDB.
- [ ] [Home in Angular](https://github.com/sero-dev/Home-Angular) - An Angular web application utilizing the Job Hunt microservice as well as other future services.
- [ ] [Portfolio Site](https://github.com/sero-dev/sero-dev.github.io) - The professional portfolio website for myself. Still working on the overall design, but I'll finish it... One day.

### What I Want to Learn/Improve on
- [ ] GitHub Workflow
- [ ] Angular
- [ ] AWS Technologies
- [ ] Azure Technologies
- [ ] Docker & Kubernetes
- [ ] NoSQL Databases
