### Hi I'm Sean,
Also known as "The Big Panda"

I am currently a Software Engineer where I work on building applications in a microservice architecture using primarily .NET. I've built applications ranging from Console applications to cloud-base solutions in Node.js, Python, Java and C++ but I've really fallen in love with the .NET family over the course of this year. I enjoy working as a Full-Stack Engineer, whether it's working on building a React/Angular/Vue web application, designing a Backend services or modeling data for a database system.
